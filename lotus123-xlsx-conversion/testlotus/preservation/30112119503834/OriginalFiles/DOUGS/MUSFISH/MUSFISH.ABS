     Scientists at the Illinois Natural History Survey River Research Laboratory are conducting laboratory experiments to assess the value of mussel beds to sport fisheries.  Mussel beds may contribute to the sport fishery by providing attractive substrate for feeding, spawning, or as nursery habitat.  Substrate preferences of fish are determined by monitoring fish position (via a computer-interfaced video camera) in aquaria containing a mussel bed on one side and one of several other substrate types (sand, silt, gravel, cobbles, etc.) on the other side.  Differences in substrate selectivity among several fish species, age classes, and during various seasons are being investigated.  If sport fishes select mussel beds over predominant substrates, increased efforts to preserve and enhance mussel beds should contribute to the protection and enhancement of sport fisheries.  This research is being funded by the Dingell-Johnson/Wallop-Breaux Sport Fishing Restoration and Enhancement Program, project F-80-R.
