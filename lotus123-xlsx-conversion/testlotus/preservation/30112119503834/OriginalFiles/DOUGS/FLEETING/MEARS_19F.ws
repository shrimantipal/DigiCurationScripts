Dear Mr. Mears:
.rm 83

We  received  a copy of your 22 January 1988 letter to Mr.  Mark  Frech,  Director, 
Illinois  Department of Conservation, concerning P.L. 88-309 Project  No.  3-373-R, 
"Effects of Fleeting on Mussel Beds" and the Annual Progress Report for 1986.  Your 
comments  will be addressed in the project completion report which is due  31  July 
1988.   However, I am including responses to your comments for your information  at 
this time.

    1.  Preparation  of  diving  equipment and  training  of  field  personnel  was 
    completed  prior to cancellation of the field effort but inadvertently was  not 
    reported in the Annual Progress Report.

    2. The applicability of a brail bar for sampling mussels is certainly dependent 
    on  the  type  of data to be collected. It is  selective  for  healthy,  active 
    mussels  rather  than  sick or dormant ones.  Few dead  mussels  are  retrieved 
    making comparisons of mortality impractical.  Depending on the size and type of 
    hook, brailing is also size selective.

    Sampling efforts using brail or dredge are not immune to disturbance by  floods 
    or many other environmental factors including temperature.  During flood  stage 
    safety  is compromised whenever tethered equipment is lowered into  the  water.  
    For  reasons  of  safety, we sometimes have had to abandon  sampling  gear  and 
    anchors  that have become entangled in debris or substrate during  high  flows.  
    Also it is difficult to pull the brail bar over the bottom at the optimum speed 
    (which is quite slow) during a flood.

    When  the  concentration of non-food particles in the  water  increases  during 
    flood,  mussels  stop  siphoning and close so they are not  vulnerable  to  the 
    brail.   Low water temperature triggers the mussel's dormant period  and  again 
    brail efforts are relatively ineffective.  

    3.  a) We contend that differences in rates of mortality, growth, and damage to 
    shells would be evident throughout the year, even if the cause for  differences 
    occurred  only during the most intensive fleeting.  Also, fleeting  does  occur 
    throughout  the year even though the highest intensity is usually in late  fall 
    and winter.  
    b)  By  continuing the project through the 1987 field season, we  have  allowed 
    additional  time  for  growth,  damage  and  mortality  to  occur,  making  any 
    differences in rates between fleeted and non-fleeted areas more detectable. 

    c)   Except  for  some  juveniles, freshwater mussels  do  not  attach  to  the 
    substrate but instead burrow down into it.  The question concerning marked  and 
    replaced mussels repositioning themselves in the substrate after disturbance is 
    a  valid  one.  Although we have no quantitative data, our experiences  on  the 
    Illinois  and  Mississippi rivers and in laboratory experiments where  we  have 
    observed  transplanted  mussels in flow-through raceways  suggest  that  active 
    mussels have little or no difficulty repositioning themselves in  predominantly 
    mud  or sand substrates characteristic of our sites at Naples.   However,  they 
    may  have difficulty repositioning themselves in rocky substrates, during  high 
    flows, and during their winter dormancy.

    We  consider thick-shelled species such as Amblema plicata relatively slow  and 
    inactive compared to more active, mobile, thin-shelled species such as Leptodea 
    fragilis  and  Potamilus  ohiensis (laevissima). Even so, I  once  recovered  a 
    specimen of A. plicata that had been marked and replaced the previous day.   It 
    was  buried in its normal position with only approximately 1 inch of its  shell 
    protruding from the substrate.  

    In addition, in our research we will be comparing mussels that were  collected, 
    marked,   and  replaced  to  others  that  underwent  the  same  treatment   at 
    approximately  the  same  time.  The only difference will be  the  exposure  to 
    fleeting.

    4.  A map of the study areas will be included in the project completion report.
