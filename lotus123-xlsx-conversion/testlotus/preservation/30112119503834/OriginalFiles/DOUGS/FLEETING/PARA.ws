                  EFFECTS OF FLEETING ON MUSSEL BEDS

     The  major objective of this research is to evaluate the effects  of  barge 

fleeting on mussel beds in light of present and projected increases in  requests 

for  fleeting  permits  along the Illinois, Mississippi,  and  other  midwestern 

rivers.   Surface  supply diving techniques were used to  collect  mussels  from 

fleeted  and  unfleeted  areas  of  the  Illinois  River  at  Naples,  Illinois.  

Collected   mussels  were  engraved  with  individual  identification   numbers, 

identified  to species, measured, and any shell damage noted, before  they  were 

replaced.   Mussels  were then recaptured annually and data collected  to  allow 

comparisons  of mortality, shell damage, and growth rates among two fleeted  and 

two unfleeted control sites.  In general, results after one year showed a  trend 

towards  higher shell damage and mortality rates and lower growth rates  in  the 

fleeted  areas than in an unfleeted controls.  However, the  only  statistically 

significant  differences among sites were growth rates for two species with  the 

largest  sample  sizes.   Since  1984 we have  marked  over  4,000  mussels  and 

recaptured  over  550.  An analysis of this data will be presented  in  a  final 

report  to  be completed in summer 1988.  This research is being funded  by  the 

U.S.  Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.L.  88-
