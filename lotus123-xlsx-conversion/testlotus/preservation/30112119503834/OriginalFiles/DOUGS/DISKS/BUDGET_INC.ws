Dear Dale:

This letter summarizes the changes that have taken place in our plans for the 
Federal Aid Project "Sport Fish Use of Mussel Beds" with particular attention 
devoted to changes in proposed budgets.

The original plan outlined in the pre-proposal (Exhibit A) was for a 3-year 
study consisting of (1) a laboratory study to determine whether fish prefer 
mussel shells to other substrate types and (2) a field study to validate results 
of the laboratory study.  The emphasis was on the laboratory study and effort 
planned for the field study was minimal.  

Initially we had staff available at the River Research Laboratory (RRL) to help 
out on this project (i.e., McLuckie, Douglas, Blodgett).  McLuckie and Douglas 
were partially funded by other projects and available to work part of the year 
on the Sport Fish/Mussel Bed project.  Blodgett was to be paid with General 
Revenue Funds ("hard money") and would have required no federal funding from the 
project.  We also planned to use a graduate student working with Dr. Richard 
Anderson (Western Illinois University, Macomb, IL) to provide part-time help for 
the duration of the project.  Responsibilities for design and administration for 
the project were to be shared by Sparks, Anderson and Blodgett -- again at no 
cost to the project.

The total estimated project cost for the pre-proposal was $84,317 and, as 
indicated on the pre-proposal form, that did not include 20% indirect costs.  A 
photocopy of the itemized budget used to calculate estimated costs for the pre-
proposal is enclosed (Exhibit B).

While the pre-proposal was being typed at the RRL and sent to the DOC, Sparks 
was at our main office on the University of Illinois campus, Champaign/Urbana, 
IL.  He became concerned about the availability of the personnel we had planned 
on using (Blodgett, McLuckie, Douglas, and a graduate student).  It appeared 
that funding for McLuckie and Douglas would lapse before the Mussel Bed/Sport 
Fish project started and they would be seeking other employment, and no "hard 
money" was available for Blodgett.  Therefore, Sparks recalculated the budget 
based on the assumption that the project would need to provide funds for all 
personnel except Sparks.  On 14 November 1986, a letter to Burkett from Sparks 
(Exhibit C) indicated costs on the pre-proposal had been underestimated.  The 
new estimated cost was $165,112 (excluding 20% indirect costs).  

After consultations with the DOC and prior to submitting the Application for 
Federal Assistance (AFA) to the DOC in February 1987, modifications were made to 
the experimental design .  The field study was eliminated from INHS project, but 
the only significant cost reduction was in travel.  A more intensive laboratory 
effort over a 2-year project was planned instead of the previously requested 3-
year project.  We anticipated it would be easier to hire full-time employees for 
2 years instead of part-time employees for 3 years.  A post-doc- or MS-level 
salary was included to provide a full-time project manager during the two year 
project.  In addition, funds for utilities at the DOC were added.  Photocopies 
of these budgets, which were submitted with the AFA, are attached (Exhibits D 
and E).

In summary, the cost of the study increased significantly from the pre-proposal 
because personnel uncertainties required that the proposed budget include 
additional funds for a full-time senior level project manager and a full-time 
technician.  When the field study was dropped, the study duration was reduced 
from 3 years to 2 years and the budget dropped from $165,112 ($198,134 with 
indirect costs) to $128,220 (153,936 with indirect costs).  Table 1 summarizes 
the estimated line item costs for the (1) pre-proposal budget, (2) revised pre-
proposal budget, and (3)the AFA budget.

                                                    Sincerely yours,



                                                    K. Douglas Blodgett
                                                    Associate Research Biologist
