Dear Mr. Little:

I recently read about your use of fish swimming activity to measure toxicity 
(February Research Information Bulletin) and would appreciate any additional 
information describing your methology that you could provide.

We are currently developing a computer-interfaced video camera system to monitor 
fish movements in behavior experiments.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
