Field_Work

     To investigate sport fish preference for and association 

with mussel beds, fish populations over mussel beds will be 

assessed and compared with populations in similar, nearby control 

areas lacking mussels.  Fish collections will be made using 

drifting trammel nets and electrofishing.  Both diurnal and 

nocturnal collections will be made seasonally, with additional 

effort in spring to determine use during spawning.  

     The study will be conducted on the lower Illinois River 

where hard substrates are generally lacking and mussel beds 

provide a distinctive habitat.

     Factors considered during site selection will include water 

depth, current velocity, substrate, navigation traffic levels, 

and inputs (tributaries, sewage treatment plants, etc.).  Field 

work to identify and document 3-5 relatively dense mussel beds 

and associated control sites should begin in spring 1987.

     We anticipate the first fish collections will be in June 

1987.  Initial collections will be used to determine subsequent 

sample sizes necessary to reveal statistically significant 

differences in fish utilization. 

Laboratory_Experiments

     A mussel population will be established and maintained on 

one side of a raceway with a sand/silt substrate.  Using known 

mussel glochidia-fish host associations, we will select 3-5 

species of sport fishes likely to demonstrate a preference for 

mussel beds.  Habitat preference of these fish will be determined 

by video monitoring of fish position in the raceway and analysis 

using a microprocessor.  Photoperiod and water temperature will 

be adjusted to simulate various seasons of the year.
