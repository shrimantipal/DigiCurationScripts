Dear Steve:

     I talked with Gail Carmody of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, Rock Island, last week about the request for federal aid 
for the telemetry study to determine effects of navigation on 
channel catfish.  She indicated that the AFA arrived at the 
regional office on 9 April and that it could be signed off by the 
first week of May.  She suggested that we contact you to see if we 
could have the initiation date of the project moved up from 1 June 
so it would coincide with the date that it is signed off by the 
USFWS regional office.

     After talking with Dale Burkett in February, we understood 
that 1 June was probably the earliest possible starting date.  As 
a result, we requested that initiation date on the AFA.  However, 
if we could move it up to the first week of May or to coincide 
with the signing by the USFWS regional office, it would be 
extremely beneficial to the project.

     Please contact me or Rip Sparks should you have questions or 
require further information.


                                        Sincerely,



                                        K. Douglas Blodgett
