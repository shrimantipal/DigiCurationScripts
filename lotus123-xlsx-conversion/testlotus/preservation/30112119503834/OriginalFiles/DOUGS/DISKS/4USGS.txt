34/8   I believe that the Kelly and Hite report you cite dealt 
     with stream sediments.  It might be important to state that.  
     Kelly and Hite have a similar report on sediments from 
     Illinois lakes that you may find useful.

     limitation from turbidity can inhibit aquatic plants.

38/10   INHS found benthic macroinvertebrate densities as low as 
     43 living organisms per square meter during sampling on the 
     lower Des Plaines in Winter 1986 (Sparks et al., 1986.  Des 
     Plaines River Long-Term Monitoring Program, Phase I Report).  

         Carp condition factors are lower on the upper Illinois 
     Waterway than on the lower Illinois River (Mills et al., 
     1966.  Man's effect on the fish and wildlife of the Illinois 
     River.  INHS Biological Notes No. 57; and INHS unpublished 
     data).  

         In general, benthic macroinvertebrate biomass and 
     diversity are lower on the upper Illinois Waterway than on 
     the lower river (Anderson, K.B.  1977.  Musculium 
     transversum in the Illinois River and an acute potassium 
     bioassay method for the species.  Unpublished Master's 
     Thesis, Western Illinois University, Macomb, Illinois.  
     86p.)

        There was a positive correlation between condition factor 
     of carp and bottom fauna biomass in the Illinois River in 
     1975 (Sparks and Sandusky, 1983).


52       Surveys of fish and benthic macroinvertebrates should be 
     conducted seasonally at or near fixed stations.  Fish 
     occurrence, abundance, and condition can and should be used 
     as indicators of water quality.  Fish mobility does not 
     preclude them from providing useful water quality 
     information.

         In addition, bioassay techniques should be used to 
     monitor water and sediment quality.  Rapid bioassay 
     techniques (such as the fingernail clam bioassay) would be 
     appropriate.

         Dissolved oxygen concentrations should be monitored.  
     These measurements should be taken before sunrise (during the 
     oxygen sag) in an attempt to detect minimum DO levels 
     (which may limit aquatic life).

55       Sediment associated metals (and other contaminants) may 
     not be biologically available.  They may also interact 
     antagonistically or synergistically.  Bioassays should be 
     used to address these problems.


Summary

     In general, the program as described will provide information 
on physical and chemical parameters, but there is little evidence 
it will address questions as to what these measurements mean to 
the living organisms (including man) in the river basin.  To many, 
an analysis of contaminant concentrations in water and sediment 
means little.  Instead they want to know the biological 
significance of the concentrations--i.e. are they limiting the 
sport fishery, is it safe to eat the fish, is it dangerous to swim 
in the water, etc.  As the demand for recreational waters 
increases, will tables of contaminant concentrations be sufficient 
to characterize the water quality of our streams and rivers? An 
approach which will answer these sort of questions should be 
evident in the program plan.  
