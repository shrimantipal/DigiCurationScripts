Katie,

These descriptions do not include the correct names, model 
numbers, etc. for the equipment.  They should be added.  The 
whole thing probably needs work.  I didn't have the time nor the 
energy to finish it.


                             Plotter


The ??? is a size E plotter which will allow us to produce hard 
copies of maps and other items (river charts, USGS quadrangle 
maps, etc.) in the more usable sizes and scales we need.  It will 
be driven by AUTOCAD software.



                            Digitizer

The Geographics digitizer will be used with MEASURGRAPH and 
AUTOCAD software to input spacial data.  These data will be used 
to prepare base maps of study areas, to document changes in the 
boundaries of streams, rivers, lakes, habitat types, plant beds; 
to record sampling sites and transects; etc.  


                       POLARIS PRINT MERGE

Our present word-processing package (WORDSTAR -- used throughout 
our Large Rivers LTER network) does not allow us to use many of 
the capabilities of our Hewlet-Packard LaserJet printer.  PRINT 
MERGE will allow us to combine different fonts and print sizes in 
the same document, simplify the use of other printer features, 
and provide additional capabilities.


                             AUTOCAD

AUTOCAD software will be used to store and manipulate spatial 
data needed in the preparation of maps; to document changes in 
the boundaries of streams, rivers, lakes, habitat types, plant 
beds; to record sampling sites and transects; etc.  For example, 
the boundaries of a particular plant bed may be layered onto a 
base map to allow us to visually reconstruct its temporal and 
spatial development.



             The BELL AND HOWELL slide making thing

The major use of the ??? will be to produce various types of 35 
mm slides including title slides, text slides, graphs, etc. for 
presentations (scientific meetings, public information, etc.).  
The ??? incorporates a POLAROID PALETTE and a QUINTAR 1080 Board 
into a single unit to provide high-resolution graphics allowing 
the production of high-quality 35 mm slides as well as other 
types of visuals.  


             MICROTEC (???) high-resolution monitor

The ????? high resolution monitor is needed to visually monitor 
the composition of graphics that will be used to produce 35 mm 
slides on the Bell and Howell thing.


                      MEASURGRAPH software

MEASURGRAPH (sp?) will be used with the GEOGRAPHICS digitizer to 
digitize data from various maps (field maps, USGS quadrangle 
maps) river charts, photographs, etc.  It will allow us to enter 
spatial data into files usuable by AUTOCAD software.  It 
calculates various parameters including distances, areas, 
volumes, and angles.
