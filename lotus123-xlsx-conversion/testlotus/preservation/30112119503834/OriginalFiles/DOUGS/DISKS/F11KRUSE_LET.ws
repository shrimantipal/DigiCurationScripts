Dear Glen:

I looked over the list of mussels being considered for addition to the  Illinois 
list of endangered and threatened species and have no problem with it.  However, 
the  following information my be useful to you.  Note that we have  not  sampled 
many  locations and have worked only on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers.   I 
have  no feeling for how scarce or localized a species must be to be  considered 
threatened or endangered.  

We  have  collected Plethobasus cyphyus occasionally.  If my  memory  serves  me 
correctly, we have taken two or three from Mississippi River Pool 15 during work 
in 1985 and 1987 and also collected one from Pool 20 around 1985.  

We routinely collect Ellipsaria lineolata from Pool 15 of the Mississippi 
River (Table 1).  In addition, we collected it in 1981 and 1982 from Pool 19 
near Ft. Madison, IA (Table 2).

If you need additional information, let me know.



                                                       Sincerely,
