Dear Dr. Arthur:

I have enclosed a map showing where we collected fingernail clams from the Des 
Plaines River in January and March of 1984. The site is in/near Forest Park.  
Clams were retrieved using a ponar dropped from the downstream side of the 
Madison Street bridge.  Shells were abundant toward the right descending bank 
(west side). The majority of the shells was dead, but I think we were able to 
collect 20-40 live ones pretty easily (within 15 minutes?).  As I remember, it 
appeared there were more living shells in January than in March.

Dr. William Steiner (then with INHS and now with USDA, Columbia, MO) used starch 
gel electrophoresis and found the Des Plaines clams were genetically distinct 
from clams we collected from Keokuk Pool, Mississippi River.  You might find 
that fingernail clams from the Keokuk population are more sensitive and may be 
too sensitive to be of any use in a monitoring program.  It would be interesting 
to use clams from both populations. 

If I can be of any assistance, let me know.
