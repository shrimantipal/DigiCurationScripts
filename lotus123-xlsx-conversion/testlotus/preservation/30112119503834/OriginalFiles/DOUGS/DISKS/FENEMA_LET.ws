Dear Steve, 

I appreciate your sending the aluminum for the engine pod.  We have 
the pod all beat out and are planning to weld it this week, and will 
also weld stops on the trailer.

We are still in need of the manuals for the Ford/Hamilton Jet and 
for the ONAN generator.  The ONAN switch is still malfunctioning and 
we are trying to get our local dealer to fix it. 

Moisture has caused the the plywood cover for the pod to swell.  It 
fits so tight that the small pull handle that is supposed to be used 
to lift it up was broken, so we need a new handle.  We are going to 
cut the cover down a bit too.

Hope things are going well for you.


                                             Sincerely,



                                             Doug Blodgett
