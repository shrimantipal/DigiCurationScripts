           Determination Whether the Causative Agent for Mussel Die-Offs 

           in the Mississippi River is of Biological or Chemical Origin

     Unexplained die-offs of freshwater mussels have occurred in the Mississippi River, including its waters in Illinois, starting in 1982 with major episodes reported again in 1983 and 1985.  Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) biologists documented a die-off in Mississippi River pools 14 and 15 in 1983 -- 33% of the mussels collected had died during the previous year.  The Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources is funding research to determine whether the cause of these die-offs is of biological (a disease or parasite) or chemical (pollution) origin.  This project is a cooperative effort among biologists at the Survey's River Research Laboratory (RRL) and fish pathologists at the Illinois Department of Conservation's Jake Wolf Memorial Fish Hatchery.  Healthy mussels were collected from the Illinois River (where no die-offs have been reported) and stocked them into raceways at the hatchery.  In the event of another die-off, dead and moribund mussels will be collected and placed into raceways with the healthy ones.  If the healthy mussels become sick, it will indicate the cause is an infectious agent transmitted from dead or moribund individuals.  If the healthy mussels are unaffected, it will indicate the die-off was caused by an environmental factor such as some contaminant released into the water.      This research also provides an opportunity to examine the commensal microflora associated with freshwater mussels.  Techniques have been developed for sampling the bacterial fauna of various mussel tissues.  Differences among bacterial species found in different tissues, different mussel species, freshly collected versus cultured mussels, healthy versus moribund mussels, and Illinois versus Mississippi River mussels are being investigated.  Over 20 species of bacteria have been identified from mussels collected in 1987.
