NOT In a tropical stream treated with a pesticide, the benthic
 community, including Naiadae, was severely affected.  Pesticide
 treatment reduced standing crop from 3,542 to 92 organisms/m-2 and
 diversity from 35 to 6 species.  Recovery of the stream was rapid
 and high densities of invertebrates were recorded after
 recolonization.  Densities of naiadids and chironomids were high
 during early recolonization but then decreased rapidly.
