NOT Analysis methods which reduce biological data, including
 species abundances, to a more useable form, such as ordination,
 classification and diversity index methods, are critically
 reviewed.  Methods which relate these reduced data to
 environmental data are also reviewed.  Classification analysis of
 biological data followed by multiple discriminant analysis of
 species-assemblage groups on environmental variables is the
 recommended procedure.  Application of these methods to pollution
 studies was discussed.
