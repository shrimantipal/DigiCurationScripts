 activities on the bottom fauna, not specifically mussels, in a
 small stream in North Carolina are discussed.  Turbidity during
 storm periods in the section of stream impacted by logging
 activities was 48 times that in an nonimpacted section.  Density
 decreased from 29.5 to 7.3 organisms/ft-2 in the impacted section.
