NOT Substrate microhabitat preferences of ten species of benthic
 macroinvertebrates were investigated in a laboratory system and 
 compared with field results.  Some species were found to select 
 microhabitats on the basis of substrate particle size while others 
 did not.  Although mussels were not directly addressed in this
 paper, the effects of substrate particle size on mussel habitat
 preference is well known.
