NOT Substrate microhabitat preferences of ten species of benthic
 macroinvertebrates were investigated in a laboratory system and 
 compared with field results.  Some species were found to select 
 microhabitats on the basis of substrate particle size while others 
 did not.  Although mussels were not directly addressed in this
 paper, the effects of substrate particle size on mussel habitat
 preference is well known.

NOT Analysis methods which reduce biological data, including
 species abundances, to a more useable form, such as ordination,
 classification and diversity index methods, are critically
 reviewed.  Methods which relate these reduced data to
 environmental data are also reviewed.  Classification analysis of
 biological data followed by multiple discriminant analysis of
 species-assemblage groups on environmental variables is the
 recommended procedure.  Application of these methods to pollution
 studies was discussed.

NOT In a tropical stream treated with a pesticide, the benthic
 community, including Naiadae, was severely affected.  Pesticide
 treatment reduced standing crop from 3,542 to 92 organisms/m-2 and
 diversity from 35 to 6 species.  Recovery of the stream was rapid
 and high densities of invertebrates were recorded after
 recolonization.  Densities of naiadids and chironomids were high
 during early recolonization but then decreased rapidly.
