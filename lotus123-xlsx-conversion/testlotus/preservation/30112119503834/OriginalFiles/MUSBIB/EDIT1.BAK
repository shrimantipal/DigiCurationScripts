 into this investigation as the basic tools were in-stream
 monitoring and effluent bioaccumulation tests.  The freshwater

 Increased Cu levels were detected in the river 37 km below the
 outfall.  There was an 80% reduction in mussel numbers 5 km below

 soft (calcium hardness of 3.2 mg/l, pH 6.8) and substrate and
 water quality were good.  Corbicula (8.93 m-2) outnumbered total
 unionids (1.24 m-2) numerically but not in total tissue dry mass
 (TDM).  Unionids had a TDM of 1704 grams m-2 while Corbicula had a

 High mercury levels in mussels were associated with elevated
 mercury levels in the environment.  Temperature did not affect
 rates of mercury uptake or loss.  Gill tissues had the
 highest concentrations while the foot had the lowest. 
 Concentrations in the foot continued to increase even after
 exposure was ceased suggesting that mercury was being metabolized
 by the liver and transported to the foot.
