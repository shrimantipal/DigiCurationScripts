Abstract: Mussels (281 individuals representing 8 species) were
     reintroduced into a section of the North Fork Holston river
     that  was recovering from a history of serious pollution.
     Prior to reintroduction, mussels had not repopulated this area
     of the river. Results of reintroduction were not reported.

Abstract: Freshwater mussels exposed to turbulence alone or
     turbulence and suspended solids reduced their metabolic rate
     in laboratory conditions.  Mussels exposed to turbulence and
     an associated increase in suspended solids every 0.5 hours
     shifted their metabolism to utilize non-protein body stores.
     Exposure every 3 hours did not cause a metabolic shift away
     from protein based catabolism.

     tensions in  sea water.  These species and Mytilus edulis, can
     regulate oxygen consumption at reduced oxygen tensions in
     diluted sea water.

     patterns, and offsetting of boundaries between shell layers.
     From these characteristics it is possible to determine what
     time of year certain shell markings were formed.  Shells found
     at ancient human occupation sites could then be used to
     determine probable season of occupation of sites.

     environmental factor affecting mussel distribution in a small
     river bed. Mussels were more concentrated where stream
     velocity was higher and were oriented with the current,
     presumably to allow for more efficient extraction of food,
     soluble mineral matter, and oxygen from the water.

Abstract: Thirteen mussel species were collected from the Red River
     Valley.  This mussel fauna originated from that of the
     Mississippi  River System.  Four ecological factors of primary
     importance in restricting mussel distribution in this valley
     were prolonged lack of river flow, high chloride content,
     water pollution, and possibly high turbidity.

     system were investigated to determine the longevity of such a
     population  and whether mussels would filter and feed on algae
     placed into the system.  Three mussels were sacrificed weekly
     to determine organ weights.  Sixteen of 69 mussels survived
     for 5 months when the experiment was concluded.  These mussels
     filtered and utilized the introduced algae Golenkinia sp.

Abstract: Speciemens of Amblema plicata were placed in a continuous
     flow system containing two concentrations of dieldrin, (20 ppb
     and 20  ppt).  Gills were monitored for dieldrin uptake and
     retention for 20 weeks.  Concentrations in the gills
     stabilized at approximately 17 ppm and 55 ppb, respectively,
     in the first two weeks of exposure. Release of dieldrin by
     naiads at 20ppb was one-sixth that of the uptake rate and
     those exposed to 20 ppt released at a rate one- forth that of
     uptake.

Abstract: Depth and substrate were determined to be two important

     complanata in  Lake Pocotopaug, Connecticut.  These mussels
     lived at depths up to 4 meters but occurred in greater
     densities between 1 and 3 meters. No significant difference in
     population density was found to occur between different types
     of coarse sediments, but the animal was absent from soft
     substrate.  Size distribution and factors effecting
     reproductive success are discussed.

Abstract: Background levels of zinc-65 were determined in oysters

     were important during most of the sampling period.  Ingestion
     by clams was heaviest in spring, early summer and fall.  Clams
     appeared to stop ingestion when water temperatures fell to
     about 2-4 degrres C.  Phytoplankton diversity in clam guts and
     in water samples was high in July and August and low in

Abstract: A short paper describing a simple method to measure flow
     rate and gill cavity pressure produced by gills of oysters and
     other molluscs.  A healthy, adult oyster could take in water
     at a  rate of 3000 cc per hour at 25 degrees C and 99.5 % of
     the diatoms and dinoflagellates present in the water were
     caught by the gills.

     was dependent on temperature and on needs of the oyster in
     relation to food requirements and clearence of body wastes.
     Oysters exposed to high levels of bacteria in suspension
     initially removed up to 49% of the bacteria from the water.
     After this point the rate of removal decreased until effluent
     leaving the body contained more bacteria than the water.

     Power Plant, Georgia, to determine 1) whether mussels were
     sensative  indicators of radionuclides, 2) whether
     radionuclides in mussel soft tissues contribute a significant
     radiation dose to the public downstream from the plant, and 3)
     biological half-lives for radionuclides in soft tissues.

Abstract: Three common methods of aging mollusks, size-frequency,
     growth line interpretation, and mark-recapture, are described
     and evaluated for accuracy.  The use of size-frequency and
     growth  line interpretation were deemed accurate only if they
     were checked by one of the other methods.  Mark-recapture was
     believed to provide reliable growth information.

Abstract: Effects of particle concentration and season on the
     filtration rates of Sphaerium striatinum were assessed by
     measuring clearance rates of small latex beads from dilute
     suspensions.  Filtration rates decreased as particle
     concentration increased.  Seasonal filtration rates for adults
     peaked during periods of greatest reproduction.  These clams
     may remove 0.0004% of the carbon that flows past them
     annually.

Abstract: An annual energy budget for a population of Sphaerium
     striatinum in Little Four Mile Creek, Ohio.  Annual
     productivity, average standing crop biomass and P:B ratios
     were determined and found to be below that expected for a
     bivoltine animal. Partitioning a large proportion of
     production to growth may insure a high probability of
     attaining the minimum size needed for reproduction.
     Comparisons of P, P:B, Re:P, and P:A with published values for
     corbiculacean clams indicates this population is very
     productive and an efficient energy partitioner.

     nitrogen budget of the marsh.  Mussels filtered 42 ug NH-3-
     N/h, or 1.8 times the particulate nitrogen exported from the
     marsh by tidal flushing.  Gamates were the largest component
     of mussel production to enter the food web, because mortality
     of adult mussels was very low.

Abstract: Unionid species such as Elliptio complanata may inhabit a
     number of different substrates and growth rates of individuals
     in  each habitat may be statistically different.  Density of
     assemblages can also affect growth rates, and certainly
     influences rates of migration.  Differential rates of growth
     in various microhabitats could account for some skewedness of
     size-frequency plots of unionid assemblages: similar-sized
     individuals could be variously aged.

Abstract: Mussel populations were surveyed in Pool 15, Upper

     especially endangered or threatened species, and density in
     areas of proposed channel excavating and spoil disposal.
     Diving, wading, snorkling and raking were the primary sampling
     methods used.  Eleven-hundred eighty-three specimens
     representing 24 unionid species were collected including one
     specimen of the endangered Lampsilis  higginsi.  Mussels
     densities as high as 136/m-2 were recorded. This survey
     confirmed that a mussel die-off had occurred in this region of
     the river.  Fifty-three percent of the mussels collected
     during this survey were recently dead.  Commercial clammers
     reported that 50 to 90 percent of Megalonaias gigantea
     collected were recently dead.  Juvenile mussels were collected
     indicating recruitment was occurring.

     were rarely found.  Average mussel density was 22 m-2 in this

     rates of  individuals in the population were inversely related

     more "comfortable" and consequently lower the amount of water
     which is transported to sense the environment.  Respiration
     rate for a mussel placed in water preconditioned by 5 mussels
     was 0.185 mg oxygen/gram mussel weight/hr and 0.164 in water

Abstract: Elliptio complanata filtering lake water was selective
     for smaller particles.  Selection was for size rather than
     particle  type.  Filtration rates varied with particle
     abundance, being as high as 30 ml/g dry tissue weight/hr at
     intermediate particle densities.

Abstract: In Morice Lake, New Brunswick, Canada, Elliptio
     complanata had a high annual production rate (2.14 g m-2/year)
     relative to other  aquatic populations.  This may be related
     to high numerical abundance (15.9 m-2) which resulted from
     availability of suitable substrates at appropriate depths and

Abstract: A calorimetric method of "wet-oxidation" applied in
     combination with assessments of "ash-free" tissue dry weights
     and shell calcium carbonate provided real measures of growth
     in molluscs.  Shell increment measurements did not give an

Abstract: Significant increase in bed load caused by floods in
     large, unstable braided rivers may lead to low density and
     diversity of  benthic macroinvertebrates.  Floods affected
     specific browsers and sedentary species more than collector-
     browsers, filter feeders, predators, and free-living species.
     Individuals exposed to high water velocity and bed load
     movement suffered catastrophic drift, physical damage, and a
     reduction of food supply.

Abstract: Using annular rings, growth rates and longevity were
     determined for nearly 1000 mussels representing 27 species
     collected from  Lake Erie.  For all species growth was most
     rapid during the first 2-5 years regardless of habitat.
     Individuals living in deeper water grew more slowly, and
     growth rates decreased after the first 1-3 years even though
     individuals may have lived to 40 years.

Abstract: Two species of freshwater mussels (Anodonta grandis, A.
     imbecilis) and their fish hosts (26 species) were collected
     from two rivers in Michigan.  Fish were checked for natural
     infections and laboratory infections were conducted to
     determine other potential hosts.  Fourteen new hosts were
     reported for A. grandis and five for A. imbecilis.  This large
     number of hosts may explain the persistence and widespread
     distribution of these species.

Keywords: Margaritifera margaritifera, physiology, behavior,
     nongame, mussel, substrate
 
Abstract: Movement of Margaritifera margaritifera and effects of
     shell shape on burrowing are discussed.  Burrowing activity in
     soft substrate involves adduction and opening of the valves
     with  protraction and retraction of the foot.  The foot is
     inserted into the substrate, expanded, and then contracted,
     pulling the mussel shell down into the substrate.  Mussels
     living on hard substrate have a similar burrowing procedure
     but without adduction, possibly because anchoring is not
     conducted in the same manner.

Abstract: A survey of the Upper Mississippi River was conducted in
     the 1920's to determine effects of sewage pollution from the
     Twin Cities on bottom fauna, plankton, and fish.  Pollution
     negatively  effected the fauna of the river downstream of the
     Twin Cities by drastically reducing oxygen levels.  Faunal
     density and diversity were reduced and species dominance
     shifted toward pollution tolerant forms.  Effects of the
     pollution were severe only during periods of low flow.
     Distributional and biological data for mussels are included.
