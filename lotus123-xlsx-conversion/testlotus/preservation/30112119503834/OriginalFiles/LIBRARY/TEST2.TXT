Abstract: A literature review on mollusk aging and life-spans

     mortality independent of  age, but in others, clear-cut
     senescence occurs in the wild state and in captivity.  Adult
     mortality during the "plateau" of vigour is extremely low.
     Senescence of annuals and biannuals commonly follows breeding.

Abstract: Approximate average rates at which the California mussel
     propels water through its gill chambers were determined.  Data
     obtained supported the conclusions that virtually all
     suspended matter is removed as water passes over the mucous
     surfaces of the gills and mantle, and that mussels propel
     water rhythmically through their filtering ststem.  In medium-
     sized animals propulsion rate has an average value of
     approximately 2.6 liters per hour. Includes a good literature
