He has been with the Survey since 1982, and holds BS and MS degrees in biology from Western Illinois University.

\tab Presently, one of Doug's major responsibilities is serving as Team Leader for the Long Term Resource Monitoring Program's (LTRMP) field station on the Illinois River at Havana, IL.  The LTRMP currently monitors water quality, vegetation and fisheries on six river reaches of the Upper Mississippi River System.  This past summer, Doug coordinated field monitoring for zebra mussels at the six LTRMP field stations -- a cooperative effort of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Environmental Management Technical Center, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, and the Natural History Survey.\par
