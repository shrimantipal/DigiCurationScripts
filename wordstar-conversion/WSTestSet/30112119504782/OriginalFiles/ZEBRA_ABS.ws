             The rapid range expansion of the recently introduced zebra mussel 
        (Dreissena polymorpha) forewarns of significant negative impacts on both the 
        ecology and economy of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS) -- a resource 
        the United States Congress has declared to be nationally significant both as 
        an ecosystem and a commercial navigation corridor.
             The first confirmed collection of a zebra mussel from the UMRS occurred 
        on 18 June 1991 in a side channel of the Illinois River near Bath, IL, 
        approximately 217 river miles (350 km) downstream from Lake Michigan and 110 
        river miles (177 km) upstream from the confluence of the Illinois and 
        Mississippi rivers.  The adult specimen was attached to a native threeridge 
        mussel (Amblema plicata) and was taken by a commercial sheller harvesting 
        freshwater mussels for use in the cultured pearl industry.  Since then, adults 
        and/or juveniles have been collected from at least seven other sites on the 
        Illinois River.  In September, zebra mussels were reported from the 
        Mississippi River as far upstream as Pool 8 near La Crosse, WI, and as far 
        downstream as the Melvin Price Locks and Dam at Alton, IL.  
             Zebra mussels are remarkably prolific: populations of up to 45 thousand 
        individuals/m2 developed within a few years after introduction into Lake Erie, 
        and densities up to 1 million/m2 may be present in power plants.  They are 
        filter feeders and remove organic detritus and plankton from the water; in 
        Lake Erie, adults filter approximately one liter of water daily.  Given their 
        potential numbers and filtering rates, zebra mussels could severely impact the 
        large floodplain river ecosystem by affecting the base of important detritus-
        based food webs.   
             In our alluvial rivers, native freshwater mussels often provide the only 
        natural, firm substrate available to macroinvertebrates for stable sites of 
        attachment for eggs, pupae, feeding nets, etc.  These native mussels and their 
        host communities provide habitat and food for small fish which are in turn 
        prey for larger fish.  Such "mussel bed ecosystems" may be disrupted if dense 
        encrustations of zebra mussels kill native mussels by overgrowing their shells 
        and mechanically interfering with siphoning or outcompeting them for food.
             Biological impacts may also manifest themselves economically by 
        affecting commercial and recreational fishing and the harvest of native mussel 
        shells for the cultured pearl industry.  Other negative economic impacts may 
        result from mechanical interference at locks and dams, clogging of municipal 
        and industrial water intakes and systems, and damage to engine cooling systems 
        of recreational and commercial vessels as well as decreased fuel efficiencies 
        due to increased drag.
             In conjunction with six Long Term Resource Monitoring Program field 
        stations on the UMRS, we have initiated a baseline monitoring effort for zebra 
        mussels.  Our major monitoring and research objectives are to:  1) document 
        the temporal and spatial distributions of zebra mussels in the UMRS;  2) 
        understand their life history in midwestern, large floodplain rivers; and  3) 
        ascertain and interpret any shifts in community structure of native biota 
        (plankton, macroinvertebrates, and fishes) resulting from the physical and 
        biological alterations the invader may cause.  A thorough understanding of 
        zebra mussels and their impacts will facilitate the development of 
        environmentally sound management strategies.
