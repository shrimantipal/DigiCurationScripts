This directory contains files that represent the "raw" content of the disk
marked "3 0112 119504717", which is a 16-sector hard-sectored 5.25" floppy
branded as a Lanier flopy.

Absent any other information, this appears to be a Lanier 103 "No Problem"
disk, from an AES/Lanier word processor marketed in the early 1980s.  The
recording method and organization is completely proprietary with 150 byte
sectors, organized in blocks of 1200 bytes each.

We have included the 70 recovered 1200 byte blocks for future recovery if needed.

This appears to be a document that starts off as follows:

                                           APPENDIX B

                                  External Advisory Committee

 

 

              This appendix consists of 3 parts:  (l) the written report of the
         External Advisory Committee (EAC) following a review of the Large River LTER
         Project, 26-28 September l983, integrated and edited by Chairman Richard
         Wiegert, (2) the minutes of a meeting on modeling, 28 September l983, attended
         by the PIs from the Large River LTER and our advisor, Richard Wiegert, and (3)
         a letter regarding data base management and hydrological modeling from EAC
         member Daryl Simons to LTER PI Nani Bhowmik.  The response to the EAC report
         is in Appendix C.

 

              The members of our External Advisory Committee are listed below.  Dr.
         Daryl Simons joined the Committee in l983 -- the others have been members
         since the inception of the LTER project in the spring of l982.  The chair has
         rotated each year, from Wayne Minshall, to Richard Wiegert, to Colbert
         Cushing, who will be Chairman of the l984/85 meeting in Champaign, Illinois,
         20-22 February l985.  The members of the Committee have paid particular
         attention to their charge to advise our group, and we are grateful for much
         personal help from each member, not reflected in the summary documents in this
         Appendix.  We look forward to their continuing assistance in the future.
