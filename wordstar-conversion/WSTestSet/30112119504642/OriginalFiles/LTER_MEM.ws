RE:   LTER manuscript list


Attached is an updated LTER manuscript list.  

Manuscripts are arranged by manuscript number.  An index is 
attached.

I need to add the manuscripts that were published before we 
started this list.  Please send me the appropriate information 
for all Large Rivers LTER-acknowledged publications missing from 
this list.

Please keep me informed of changes in status and of any additions 
or deletions!

Updated (or corrected) lists will be circulated periodically.

Share this with other authors as needed.
