                           Equipment and Procedures

Electrofishing

      Electrofishing equipment was assembled by LTRMP personnel in compliance
with LTRMP specifications.  We will use a 5.5-meter (m) welded aluminum plate
boat powered by a 110-hp outboard.   A 5-kw generator will supply 250-volt AC
current to a control box (built by Burke O'Neal, University of Wisconsin -
Madison, Engineering Technical Services) mounted near the pilot.  The control box
converts the AC current to pulsed-DC current with voltage, amperage, duty cycle
and pulse rate controlled by the pilot.  Pulsed-DC current is delivered to two
1-m-diameter stainless steel rings supported by two booms at the bow of the boat. 
Four equally spaced stainless steel droppers (anodes) are suspended from each
ring.  The boat hull acts as the cathode.  This equipment allows us to produce
pulsed-DC fields of varying wattages with consistent dimensions.
      Electrofishing runs will be 200 m in length and 15 minutes (min) in
duration.  Actual distance and time sampled will be recorded for each run. 
Before each electrofishing run we measure water temperature and specific
conductance to identify proper voltage and amperage settings needed to reach the
power goal for the 4500-watt power base.
      Dippers use 2.4-m-long dipnets with a 25.4-centimeter (cm)-deep, 3-
millimeter (mm) mesh bag.  Dippers net each fish as it appears, regardless of
size or species.

Hoopnetting 

      We use three varieties of hoopnets.  Small seven-hoop hoopnets are 0.6 m
in diameter, 3 m in length, of asphalt-coated No. 9 nylon netting with a bar mesh
length of 1.8 cm.  Nets have two finger-style throats at the second and fourth
hoops:  the first throat is 14 meshes in length with an opening 28 meshes in
circumference, while the second throat is 12.5 meshes in length with an opening
22 meshes in circumference. 
      Large seven-hoop hoopnets are 1.2 m in diameter, 4.8 m in length, and made
of asphalt-coated No. 8 nylon netting with a bar mesh length of 3.7 cm: the first
throat is 15.5 meshes long with an opening 35 meshes in circumference, and the
second throat is 13.5 meshes long with an opening 26 meshes in circumference.  
      All hoopnets are fished in tandem: the large upstream net is secured with
a stob attached to the net with a 15-m rope (Figure 3).  The smaller downstream
net is attached to the three-string bridle of the upstream net with a 15-m rope,
and anchored downstream with a net anchor attached by a 15-m rope to a three
string bridle.  Both nets are fished with the open end facing downstream, and
three kg of soybean bait in each net.
      

Fykenetting

      Large Wisconsin-type fykenets are made of asphalt-coated No. 12 nylon twine
with 1.8 cm bar mesh and have three sections.  The lead is 15 m long and 1 m
tall; the cab is formed by two spring steel frames which are 1 m tall and 2 m
wide; the hooped section consists of six, 0.9 m-diameter steel hoops.          
   
      Small Wisconsin-design minnow fykenets are made of green-dipped 3 mm-mesh
"Ace" nylon netting and have three sections.  The lead is 6.1 m long and 0.6 m
tall; the cab is formed by two steel frames which are 0.6 m tall and 1.2 m wide;
the hooped section consists of two, 0.6-m-diameter steel hoops.
      In contiguous backwater habitats, large fykenets are set perpendicular to
the shore (Figure 3) with the lead secured at the water's edge.  When set in
vegetated areas, the lead is secured 1 m into the vegetation bed and extended
perpendicular to the vegetation edge.  Small (minnow) fyke nets are set in a
similar fashion.

Seining

      Seines are made of 3-mm-mesh "Ace" nylon netting.  Seines are 10.7 m long
and 1.8 m tall, with a 0.9- X 0.9- X 0.9-m bag at the center. 
      Seines are pulled along shore in unvegetated contiguous backwater habitats. 
One end of the seine is held stationary on shore, while the other end is deployed
perpendicular to shore and pulled downstream in a 90 degree arc.

Trawling

      We use two-seam, slingshot, balloon trawls 4.8 m wide, and 8 m long with
a 3 mm-mesh bag liner (TRL16BC, Memphis Net and Twine Co., Inc.).  The trawl is
towed downstream with two 75- X 37-cm otter boards attached to the boat by two
30-m tow lines.  A float is attached to each tow line near the boat and another
float is attached to the net by a 10 m-line.  Floats are used to aid in retrieval
of the trawl when it becomes snagged.  Trawls are towed by boat moving slightly
faster than the current, in a downstream direction for approximately 350 m or 8
min.

                                       
                                Fish Handling 

      Upon collection, fish will be placed in a holding tank.  Fish will then be
weighed to the nearest gram (g), measured to the nearest millimeter (mm) total
length, and examined for external parasites and physical abnormalities.  All fish
will be released immediately after processing, except for those retained for
reference collections or to verify identification.
