  RE:  Annual Report

DATE:  2 August l984



      A draft version of our annual report is enclosed for your 
reveiw.  Please get your comments to me by l5 August, when Vicky 
Atchley will begin typing the final draft.  I will need good 
photographic prints or PMTs of your figures, in a size which will 
fit on our standard 8 l/2 x ll paper.  Please check the figures 
and make sure you have sent me prints or high quality 
reproducable copies.

     I believe our sections on shortfalls, project plan, and most 
significant accomplishment accomplishment need revision and 
strengthening, and I will appreciate your suggestions.

     Table l is mostly blank space right now and I would like to 
see it fill up and even extend over several pages! 

     Make sure your current and pending support and lists of 
publications and products are updated and inclusive.  Also check 
over the list products of PIs and staff and the authors for each 
section. 

     Best wishes to everyone who is going to the ESA/AIBS meeting 
in Colorado and especially to Anderson and Lubinski who are 
presenting papers!
