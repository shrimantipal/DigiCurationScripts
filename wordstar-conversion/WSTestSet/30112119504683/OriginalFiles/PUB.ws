Hydrology Intersite Activities
  
     During  the LTER Scientists' meeting at Itasca Park in May  l984, 
the hydraulic engineers from our site agreed to summarize the 
hydraulic, hydrologic, and meteorological data being collected at 
all the LTER sites.  A detailed information form has been 
sent to all LTER Project Directors.  A composite 
listing will be made and distributed to all the sites.  The 
benefits of such an intersite activity will be:

l.   Compilation  of  the hydraulic,  hydrologic,  and  sediment  data 
collected at all sites.

2.   Identification  of  areas  where  additional  data  should   be 
collected.

3.   Exchange of intersite know-how and assistance.

4.   Formulation of intersite comparative studies.

5.    Close cooperation between scientists working at various sites in 
different geographic, physiographic, and climatic settings.
