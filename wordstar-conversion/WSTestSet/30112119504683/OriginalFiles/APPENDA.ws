                Appendix A:  Changes in Personnel

     Richard Allgire, Technician, resigned 31 December 1983.  His 
position has been filled by Frank S. Dillon who joined the Water 
Survey 1 December 1983.  Mr. Dillon has an M.S. in Biology from 
Western Illinois University.

     Robert Sinclair, Data Manager, resigned in January 1983, and 
has been replaced by Frank Brookfield.  Mr. Brookfield has a B.S. 
in business and management information systems and is the 
Programmer at the Natural History Survey.

     Deborah Casavant, Graduate Research Assistant in Geology, 
completed her employment on the LTER project in May.  She is 
continuing voluntary work on the project through the remainder of 
l984.  Another graduate student in geology will be employed in 
January l985.






































    Appendix E:  Collaborative Research and Liaison Activities

     J. Roger Adams visited the St. Louis District, U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers on 25 April 1984.  Soundings and contour maps 
of the river bed in the immediate vicinity of the construction 
site for Replacement Lock and Dam 26 have been furnished by the 
Corps.  Additional hydrographic data will be provided to us in 
the future by Jerry Rap of the St. Louis District staff.

     The Upper Mississippi River Basin Association has continued 
the long-term loan to the LTER project of approximately $50,000 
worth of electronic distance measuring equipment, an electronic 
oceanographic current meter, minicomputer, and miscellaneous 
sampling gear.  The Association receives copies of our publications 
and annual reports.

     The Large Rivers LTER project is making extensive use of the 
Prime 750 computer and Geographic Information System software 
belonging to the Illinois Lands Unsuitable for Mining Program 
(ILUMP).  The LTER project has added terminals and disk storage 
capacity to the system, with the understanding there will be no 
charge to LTER for computer time.  Thus LTER benefits substantially 
from use of facilities of another federally funded project and 
contributes map information (vegetation, bed substrate) and a 
floodplain river model to ILUMP.  It is interesting that the first 
case considered by ILUMP was a fish and wildlife conservation area 
in the floodplain of the Illinois River.  The area included a 
floodplain lake, wetlands and bottomland forest, underlain by an 
economically extractable coal deposit.  While LTER was just 
starting up and did not contribute to the decision to declare the 
area unsuitable for mining, we expect LTER data and models will be 
useful in future decisions involving alteration of floodplain 
rivers.
